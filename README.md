# Sentiment-Analysis-of-Universal-Studios-Reviews-Using-Machine-Learning-Techniques

The objective of this project is to build an information retrieval system for sentiment analysis. The Universal Studios reviews from TripAdvisor was crawled and consolidated into a csv file. 

I then worked in a team to explore the classification approaches that can help with sentiment analysis. 

We have used 2 types of deep learning models for our classification approach and have compared the
performance between each of these models. The 2 models that were developed include:

- Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)
- Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM)

We also explored ways for enhancing classification, such as working on a framework based on the ensemble of CNN and LSTM models to perform sentiment analysis.
