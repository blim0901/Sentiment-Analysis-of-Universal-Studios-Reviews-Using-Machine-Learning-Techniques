2. 'Deep Learning Models' folder: This folder contains all the models that we have trained to do the classification of the reviews. 'CNN_LSTM_Ensemble.ipynb' is the Jupyter notebook file that has the codes and results for CNN, LSTM and the Ensemble method. 'CNN_Two_Classes.ipynb' is the Jupyter notebook file that contains the codes for CNN when we train the model with 2 classes. The models folder contained within just have the h5 files that are the same as the ones in the Jupyter notebook files.


# To run the codes, you will need to install additional packages and libraries that are listed below
